Abstract: 
Nutrition & Physical activity are important parts of healthy lifestyle when someone 
has diabetes. Along with other benefits; following a healthy meal plan & being 
physical active can help you to keep blood glucose level or blood sugar in your target 
range. 
Diabetes is a disorder that can’t be cured. But with proper diet & physical activity 
anyone can survive with diabetes. In case of diet one should give proper 
concentration of blood glucose level which is controlled by carbohydrate 
consumption 
So Carbohydrate consumption must be measured by any diabetic patient. 
Generally a diabetic patient should consume around 1800-1850 calories a day as 
well as 800-900 calories from carbohydrate. 
At 4 calories per gram one should consume 200-250 gm of carb. 
 
In this section I have tried to design a diet chart with proper calories 
consumption along with carbohydrate counting.
