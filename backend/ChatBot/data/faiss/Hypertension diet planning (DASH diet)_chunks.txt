Introduction
Introduction
What you choose to eat affects your chances of developing high
blood pressure, or hypertension (the medical term). Recent studies
show that blood pressure can be lowered by following the Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan—and by 
eating less salt, also called sodium.
While each step alone lowers blood pressure, the combination of the
eating plan and a reduced sodium intake gives the biggest benefit
and may help prevent the development of high blood pressure.
This booklet, based on the DASH research findings, tells how 
to follow the DASH eating plan and reduce the amount of sodium 
you consume. It offers tips on how to start and stay on the eating
plan, as well as a week of menus and some recipes. The menus 
and recipes are given for two levels of daily sodium consumption—
2,300 and 1,500 milligrams per day. Twenty-three hundred 
milligrams is the highest level considered acceptable by the National
High Blood Pressure Education Program. It is also the highest
amount recommended for healthy Americans by the 2005 “U.S.
Dietary Guidelines for Americans.” The 1,500 milligram level can
lower blood pressure further and more recently is the amount 
recommended by the Institute of Medicine as an adequate intake
level and one that most people should try to achieve.
The lower your salt intake is, the lower your blood pressure.
Studies have found that the DASH menus containing 2,300 mil-
ligrams of sodium can lower blood pressure and that an even 
lower level of sodium, 1,500 milligrams, can further reduce blood
pressure.
---
All the menus are lower in sodium than what adults 
in the United States currently eat—about 4,200 milligrams per day 
in men and 3,300 milligrams per day in women.
Those with high blood pressure and prehypertension may benefit 
especially from following the DASH eating plan and reducing their
sodium intake.

Blood pressure is the force of blood against artery walls. It is 
measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and recorded as two
numbers—systolic pressure (when the heart beats) over diastolic 
pressure (when the heart relaxes between beats). Both numbers are 
important. (See box 1 on page 4.)
Blood pressure rises and falls during the day. But when it stays 
elevated over time, then it's called high blood pressure. High blood
pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard, and
the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such
as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. High blood pressure often
has no warning signs or symptoms. Once it occurs, it usually lasts a
lifetime. If uncontrolled, it can lead to heart and kidney disease,
stroke, and blindness.
High blood pressure affects more than 65 million—or 1 in 3—
American adults. About 28 percent of American adults ages 18 and
older, or about 59 million people, have prehypertension, a condition
that also increases the chance of heart disease and stroke.
---
High
blood pressure is especially common among African Americans,
who tend to develop it at an earlier age and more often than Whites.
It is also common among older Americans—individuals with normal
blood pressure at age 55 have a 90 percent lifetime risk for develop-
ing high blood pressure.
High blood pressure can be controlled if you take these steps: 
■Maintain a healthy weight.
■Be moderately physically active on most days of the week.
■Follow a healthy eating plan, which includes foods lower in sodium.
■If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.
■If you have high blood pressure and are prescribed medication, 
take it as directed.
All steps but the last also help to prevent high blood pressure.

What Is the DASH Eating Plan?
Blood pressure can be unhealthy even if it stays only slightly above
the normal level of less than 120/80 mmHg. The more your blood
pressure rises above normal, the greater the health risk.
Scientists supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute (NHLBI) conducted two key studies.
---
Their findings
showed that blood pressures were reduced with an eating plan that
is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat and that emphasizes
fruits, vegetables, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products.
This eating plan—known as the DASH eating plan—also includes
whole grain products, fish, poultry, and nuts. It is reduced in lean
red meat, sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages 
compared to the typical American diet. It is rich in potassium, 
magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein and fiber. (See box 2 
for the DASH studies’ daily nutrient goals.)

* 1,500 mg sodium was a lower goal tested and found to be even better for 
lowering blood pressure. It was particularly effective for middle-aged and older 
individuals, African Americans, and those who already had high blood pressure.
g = grams; mg = milligrams
The DASH eating plan follows heart healthy guidelines to limit 
saturated fat and cholesterol. It focuses on increasing intake 
of foods rich in nutrients that are expected to lower blood pressure,
mainly minerals (like potassium, calcium, and magnesium), protein,
and fiber. It includes nutrient-rich foods so that it meets other
nutrient requirements as recommended by the Institute of Medicine.
The first DASH study involved 459 adults with systolic blood 
pressures of less than 160 mmHg and diastolic pressures of 80–95
mmHg. About 27 percent of the participants had high blood 
pressure. About 50 percent were women and 60 percent were
African Americans. It compared three eating plans: a plan that
includes foods similar to what many Americans regularly eat; a plan
that includes foods similar to what many Americans regularly eat
plus more fruits and vegetables; and the DASH eating plan. All
three plans included about 3,000 milligrams of sodium daily.
None of the plans was vegetarian or used specialty foods.
Results were dramatic. Participants who followed both the plan
that included more fruits and vegetables and the DASH eating plan
had reduced blood pressure.

The DASH studies were sponsored by the NHLBI and conducted 
at four medical centers. There was also a central coordinating
center at Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in
Portland, OR. The four medical centers were: Brigham and
Women's Hospital, Boston, MA; Duke Hypertension Center and the
Sarah W. Stedman Nutrition and Metabolism Center, Durham, NC;
Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD; and
Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA.

greatest effect, especially for those with high blood pressure.
Furthermore, the blood pressure reductions came fast—within 
2 weeks of starting the plan.
The second DASH study looked at the effect on blood pressure 
of a reduced dietary sodium intake as participants followed either
the DASH eating plan or an eating plan typical of what many
Americans consume. This second study involved 412 participants.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two eating plans
and then followed for a month at each of the three sodium levels.
The three sodium levels were a higher intake of about 3,300 
milligrams per day (the level consumed by many Americans), an
intermediate intake of about 2,300 milligrams per day, and a lower
intake of about 1,500 milligrams per day.
Results showed that reducing dietary sodium lowered blood pressure
for both eating plans. At each sodium level, blood pressure was
lower on the DASH eating plan than on the other eating plan. The
greatest blood pressure reductions were for the DASH eating plan 
at the sodium intake of 1,500 milligrams per day. Those with high
blood pressure saw the greatest reductions, but those with prehyper-
tension also had large decreases.
Together these studies show the importance of lowering sodium
intake—whatever your eating plan. For a true winning combina-
tion, follow the DASH eating plan and lower your intake of salt and
sodium.
How Do I Make the DASH?
The DASH eating plan used in the studies calls for a certain number
of daily servings from various food groups. These are given in box
3 on page 8 for 2,000 calories per day. The number of servings you
require may vary, depending on your caloric need.
---
Box 4 on page
10 gives the number of servings for 1,600, 2,600, and 3,100 calories.
The DASH eating plan used along with other lifestyle changes can
help you prevent and control blood pressure. If your blood pressure
is not too high, you may be able to control it entirely by changing
your eating habits, losing weight if you are overweight, getting 
regular physical activity, and cutting down on alcohol.
---
The DASH
eating plan also has other benefits, such as lowering LDL (“bad”)
cholesterol, which, along with lowering blood pressure, can reduce
your risk for getting heart disease.

take it with you when you go to the store.
‡ Since eggs are high in cholesterol, limit egg yolk intake to no more than four per 
week; two egg whites have the same protein content as 1 oz of meat.
§ Fat content changes serving amount for fats and oils. For example, 1 Tbsp of
regular salad dressing equals one serving; 1 Tbsp of a low-fat dressing equals 
one-half serving; 1 Tbsp of a fat-free dressing equals zero servings.
If you need to lose weight, even a small weight loss will help to
lower your risks of developing high blood pressure and other serious
health conditions. At the very least, you should not gain weight.
A recent study showed that people can lose weight while following
the DASH eating plan and lowering their sodium intake. In a study
of 810 participants, one-third were taught how to lower their 
sodium intake and follow the DASH eating plan on their own.
Most of them needed to lose weight as well. They followed the
DASH eating plan at lower calorie levels and they increased their
physical activity. Over the course of 18 months, participants lost
weight and improved their blood pressure control.

I was overweight. I was told by my doctor that
if I kept it up I was going to develop high blood
pressure and high blood cholesterol. The doctor
sent me to a dietitian. She is the one who
taught me the things that I had to do in order to
eat right.

It was hard at the beginning because
once you have bad habits they are hard to
break. Once I realized it was for my own good
and no one was going to take care of me except
me, I decided to start eating better. At home,
we keep stuff like fruits, vegetables, and  
low-fat or fat-free milk in the house.

Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH
If you’re trying to lose weight, use the foods and serving guidelines
in boxes 3 and 4 on pages 8 and 9. Aim for a caloric level that is
lower than what you usually consume. In addition, you can make
your diet lower in calories by using the tips in box 5. The best way
to take off pounds is to do so gradually, get more physical activity,
and eat a balanced diet that is lower in calories and fat. For some
people at very high risk for heart disease or stroke, medication 
will be necessary. To develop a weight-loss or weight-maintenance
program that works well for you, consult with your doctor or 
registered dietitian.
Combining the DASH eating plan with a regular physical activity
program, such as walking or swimming, will help you both shed
pounds and stay trim for the long term. You can do an activity 
for 30 minutes at one time, or choose shorter periods of at least 
10 minutes each. (See box 6 on page 14.) The important thing is to
total about 30 minutes of activity each day. (To avoid weight gain,
try to total about 60 minutes per day.) 
You should be aware that the DASH eating plan has more daily
servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grain foods than you may
be used to eating. Because the plan is high in fiber, it can cause
bloating and diarrhea in some persons. To avoid these problems,
gradually increase your intake of fruit, vegetables, and whole 
grain foods.
This booklet gives menus and recipes from the DASH studies for
both 2,300 and 1,500 milligrams of daily sodium intake.
---
Twenty-
three hundred milligrams of sodium equals about 6 grams, or 
1 teaspoon, of table salt (sodium chloride); 1,500 milligrams of 
sodium equals about 4 grams, or 2/3 teaspoon, of table salt.
The key to reducing salt intake is making wise food choices. Only 
a small amount of salt that we consume comes from the salt added
at the table, and only small amounts of sodium occur naturally in
food. Processed foods account for most of the salt and sodium
Americans consume. So, be sure to read food labels to choose 
products lower in sodium. You may be surprised to find which
foods have sodium. They include baked goods, certain cereals, soy
sauce, seasoned salts, monosodium glutamate (MSG), baking soda,
and some antacids—the range is wide.

How to Lower Calories on 
the DASH Eating Plan
The DASH eating plan can be adopted to promote weight loss. It is
rich in lower-calorie foods, such as fruits and vegetables. You can
make it lower in calories by replacing higher calorie foods such as
sweets with more fruits and vegetables—and that also will make it 
easier for you to reach your DASH goals. Here are some examples:
To increase fruits—
●
Eat a medium apple instead of four shortbread cookies. You’ll save 
80 calories.
●
Eat 1/4 cup of dried apricots instead of a 2-ounce bag of pork rinds.
You’ll save 230 calories.
To increase vegetables—
●
Have a hamburger that’s 3 ounces of meat instead of 6 ounces. 
Add a 1/2-cup serving of carrots and a 1/2-cup serving of spinach. 
You’ll save more than 200 calories.
●
Instead of 5 ounces of chicken, have a stir fry with 2 ounces of 
chicken and 11/2 cups of raw vegetables. Use a small amount of 
vegetable oil. You'll save 50 calories.
To increase fat-free or low-fat milk products—
●
Have a 1/2-cup serving of low-fat frozen yogurt instead of a 1/2-cup 
serving of full-fat ice cream.
---
You’ll save about 70 calories.
And don’t forget these calorie-saving tips:
●
Use fat-free or low-fat condiments.
●
Use half as much vegetable oil, soft or liquid margarine, mayonnaise,
or salad dressing, or choose available low-fat or fat-free versions.
●
Eat smaller portions—cut back gradually.
●
Choose fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products.
●
Check the food labels to compare fat content in packaged foods—
items marked fat-free or low-fat are not always lower in calories than 
their regular versions.
●
Limit foods with lots of added sugar, such as pies, flavored yogurts, 
candy bars, ice cream, sherbet, regular soft drinks, and fruit drinks.
●
Eat fruits canned in their own juice or in water.
●
Add fruit to plain fat-free or low-fat yogurt.
●
Snack on fruit, vegetable sticks, unbuttered and unsalted popcorn, 
or rice cakes.
●
Drink water or club soda—zest it up with a wedge of lemon or lime.

Thirty minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each day can help.
●
If your blood pressure is moderately elevated, 30 minutes of brisk 
walking on most days a week may be enough to keep you off 
medication.
●
If you take medication for high blood pressure, 30 minutes of 
moderate physical activity can make your medication work more 
effectively and make you feel better.
●
If you don’t have high blood pressure, being physically active can 
help keep it that way. If you have normal blood pressure—but are 
not active—your chances of developing high blood pressure 
increase, especially as you get older or if you become overweight 
or obese or develop diabetes.
Getting started: Your physical activity program can be as simple as a
15-minute walk around the block each morning and evening. Gradually
build up your program and set new goals to stay motivated. The
important thing is to find something you enjoy, and do it safely. And
remember—trying too hard at first can lead to injury and cause you 
to give up. If you have a chronic health problem or a family history of
heart disease at an early age, be sure to talk with your doctor before
launching a new physical activity program.
1. Set a schedule and try to keep it.
2. Get a friend or family member to join you.
---
Motivate each other 
to keep it up.
3. Cross-train. Alternate between different activities so you don’t 
strain one part of your body day after day.
4. Set goals.
5. Reward yourself. At the end of each month that you stay on your 
exercise program, reward yourself with something new—new 
clothes, a compact disc, a new book—something that will help keep
you committed. But don't use food as a reward.

Because it is rich in fruits and vegetables, which are naturally lower
in sodium than many other foods, the DASH eating plan makes it
easier to consume less salt and sodium. Still, you may want to begin
by adopting the DASH eating plan at the level of 2,300 milligrams
of sodium per day and then further lower your sodium intake to
1,500 milligrams per day.
Boxes 7, 8, and 9 on pages 16–18 offer tips on how to reduce the
salt and sodium content in your diet, and boxes 10 and 11 on pages
19 and 20 show how to use food labels to find lower sodium products.
The DASH eating plan also emphasizes potassium from food, 
especially fruits and vegetables, to help keep blood pressure levels
healthy. A potassium-rich diet may help to reduce elevated or high
blood pressure, but be sure to get your potassium from food
sources, not from supplements. Many fruits and vegetables, some
milk products, and fish are rich sources of potassium. (See box 12
on page 21.) However, fruits and vegetables are rich in the form of
potassium (potassium with bicarbonate precursors) that favorably
affects acid-base metabolism. This form of potassium may help to
reduce risk of kidney stones and bone loss. While salt substitutes
containing potassium are sometimes needed by persons on drug
therapy for high blood pressure, these supplements can be harmful
to people with certain medical conditions.
---
Ask your doctor before
trying salt substitutes or supplements.
Start the DASH eating plan today—it can help you prevent and 
control high blood pressure, has other health benefits for your heart,
can be used to lose weight, and meets your nutritional needs.

Tips To Reduce Salt and
Sodium 
●
Choose low- or reduced-sodium, or no-salt-added versions of foods 
and condiments when available.
●
Choose fresh, frozen, or canned (low-sodium or no-salt-added) 
vegetables.
●
Use fresh poultry, fish, and lean meat, rather than canned, smoked, 
or processed types.
●
Choose ready-to-eat breakfast cereals that are lower in sodium.
●
Limit cured foods (such as bacon and ham); foods packed in 
brine (such as pickles, pickled vegetables, olives, and 
sauerkraut); and condiments (such as mustard, horseradish, 
ketchup, and barbecue sauce). Limit even lower sodium versions 
of soy sauce and teriyaki sauce. Treat these condiments sparingly 
as you do table salt.
●
Cook rice, pasta, and hot cereals without salt. Cut back on instant 
or flavored rice, pasta, and cereal mixes, which usually have 
added salt.
●
Choose “convenience” foods that are lower in sodium.

frozen dinners, mixed dishes such as pizza, packaged mixes, 
canned soups or broths, and salad dressings—these often have a 
lot of sodium.
●
Rinse canned foods, such as tuna and 
canned beans, to remove some of
the sodium.
●
Use spices instead of salt.
In cooking and at the table, 
flavor foods with herbs, 
spices, lemon, lime, 
vinegar, or salt-free 
seasoning blends. Start 
by cutting salt in half.

Reducing Salt and Sodium
When Eating Out
●Ask how foods are prepared. Ask that they be prepared 
without added salt, MSG, or salt-containing ingredients. Most 
restaurants are willing to accommodate requests.
●Know the terms that indicate high sodium content: pickled, 
cured, smoked, soy sauce, broth.
●Move the salt shaker away.
●Limit condiments, such as mustard, ketchup, pickles, and 
sauces with salt-containing ingredients.
●Choose fruit or vegetables, instead of salty snack foods.

Compare Nutrition Facts
Labels on Foods
Read the Nutrition Facts labels on foods to compare the amount of
sodium in products. Look for the sodium content in milligrams and the
Percent Daily Value. Aim for foods that are less than 5 percent of the
Daily Value of sodium. Foods with 20 percent or more Daily Value of
sodium are considered high. You can also check out the amounts of
the other DASH goal nutrients.
Compare the food labels of these two versions of canned tomatoes.
The regular canned tomatoes (right) have 15 times as much sodium as
the low-sodium canned tomatoes.

There’s a history of cardiovascular disease in
my family and I also know that good habits
can start when the children
are very young. In my 
family, we are physically
active, we drink water and
low-fat or fat-free milk,
and we rarely keep
sugary snacks in
the house. I'm
also very aware
of portion sizes
and how many
calories are in
the portions we
eat. We are teach-
ing them good
eating habits
right now.
“
”
How Can I Get Started on the DASH Eating Plan?
It’s easy. Reading the “Getting Started” suggestions in box 13 should
help you along the way. The DASH eating plan requires no special
foods and has no hard-to-follow recipes. One way to begin is by 
seeing how DASH compares with your current food habits. Use the
“What’s On Your Plate?” form. (See box 14 on page 26.) Fill it in for
1–2 days and see how it compares with the DASH plan. This will
help you see what changes you need to make in your food choices.
Remember that on some days the foods you eat may add up to more
than the recommended servings from one food group and less from
another. Similarly, you may have too much sodium on a particular
day. But don't worry. Try your best to keep the average of several
days close to the DASH eating plan and the sodium level recom-
mended for you.
Use the menus that begin on page 30 if you want to follow the
menus similar to those used in the DASH trial—or make up your
own using your favorite foods. In fact, your entire family can eat
meals using the DASH eating plan. Use box 3 on page 8 to choose
your favorite foods from each food group based on your calorie
needs as described in the 2005 “U.S.
---
Dietary Guidelines for
Americans.”
The Dietary Guidelines determined that the DASH eating plan is an
example of a healthy eating plan and recommends it as a plan that
not only meets your nutritional needs but can accommodate varied
types of cuisines and special needs.
Remember that the DASH eating plan used along with other lifestyle
changes can help you prevent and control your blood pressure.
Important lifestyle recommendations for you include: achieve and
maintain a healthy weight, participate in your favorite regular 
physical activity, and, if you drink, use moderation in alcohol 
consumption (defined as up to one drink per day for women and 
up to two drinks per day for men).
One important note: If you take medication to control high blood
pressure, you should not stop using it. Follow the DASH eating plan
and talk with your doctor about your medication treatment. The tips
in box 15 on page 27 can help you continue to follow the DASH 
eating plan and make other healthy lifestyle changes for a lifetime.

Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH
Getting Started
It’s easy to adopt the DASH eating plan. Here are some ways to
get started:
Change gradually
●If you now eat one or two vegetables a day, add a serving at 
lunch and another at dinner.
●If you don't eat fruit now or have juice only at breakfast, add a 
serving to your meals or have it as a snack.
●Gradually increase your use of fat-free and low-fat milk and milk 
products to three servings a day. For example, drink milk with 
lunch or dinner, instead of soda, sugar-sweetened tea, or 
alcohol. Choose fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1 percent) milk and 
milk products to reduce your intake of saturated fat, total fat, 
cholesterol, and calories and to increase your calcium.
●Read the Nutrition Facts label on margarines and salad dressings 
to choose those lowest in saturated fat and trans fat.
Treat meats as one part of the whole meal, instead of 
the focus
●Limit lean meats to 6 ounces a day—all that's needed.
---
Have 
only 3 ounces at a meal, which is about the size of a deck 
of cards.
●If you now eat large portions of meats, cut them back gradually—
by a half or a third at each meal.
●Include two or more vegetarian-style (meatless) meals each 
week.
●Increase servings of vegetables, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, 
and cooked dry beans in meals. Try casseroles, whole wheat 
pasta, and stir-fry dishes, which have less meat and more 
vegetables, grains, and dry beans.
B O X  1 3
25
What Is the DASH Eating Plan?
Use fruits or other foods low in saturated fat, trans fat, cho-
lesterol, sodium, sugar, and calories as desserts and snacks
●Fruits and other lower fat foods offer great taste and variety. Use 
fruits canned in their own juice or packed in water. Fresh fruits 
require little or no preparation. Dried fruits are a good choice to 
carry with you or to have ready in the car.
●Try these snacks ideas: unsalted rice cakes; nuts mixed with 
raisins; graham crackers; fat-free and low-fat yogurt and frozen 
yogurt; popcorn with no salt or butter added; raw vegetables.
Try these other tips
●Choose whole grain foods for most grain servings to get added 
nutrients, such as minerals and fiber. For example, choose 
whole wheat bread or whole grain cereals.
●If you have trouble digesting milk and milk products, try taking 
lactase enzyme pills (available at drugstores and groceries) with 
the milk products. Or, buy lactose-free milk, which has the 
lactase enzyme already added to it.
●If you are allergic to nuts, use seeds or legumes (cooked dried 
beans or peas).
●Use fresh, frozen, or low-sodium canned vegetables and fruits.
Use the form in box 14 to track your food and physical activities
habits before you start on the DASH eating plan or to see how
you're doing after a few
weeks. To record more
than 1 day, just copy the
form. Total each day's
food groups and compare
what you ate with the
DASH eating plan.

pleted, check the menus

What Is the DASH Eating Plan?
Making the DASH to 
Good Health
The DASH plan is a new way of eating—for a lifetime. If you slip from
the eating plan for a few days, don't let it keep you from reaching your
health goals. Get back on track. Here’s how:
Ask yourself why you got off-track.
Was it at a party? Were you feeling stress at home or work? Find out
what triggered your sidetrack and start again with the DASH plan.
Don’t worry about a slip.
Everyone slips—especially when learning something new. Remember
that changing your lifestyle is a long-term process.
See if you tried to do too much at once.
Often, those starting a new lifestyle try to change too much at once.
Instead, change one or two things at a time. Slowly but surely is the
best way to succeed. 
Break the process down into small steps.
This not only keeps you from trying to do too much at once, but also
keeps the changes simpler. Break complex goals into smaller, simpler
steps, each of which is attainable.
Write it down.
Use the table in box 14 to keep track of what you eat and what you’re
doing. This can help you find the problem. Keep track for several days.
You may find, for instance, that you eat high-fat foods while watching
television.
---
If so, you could start keeping a substitute snack on hand 
to eat instead of the high-fat foods. This record also helps you be 
sure you’re getting enough of each food group and physical activity
each day.
Celebrate success.
Treat yourself to a nonfood treat for your accomplishments.

A Week With the DASH Eating Plan
A Week With 
the DASH Eating Plan
Here is a week of menus from the DASH eating plan. The menus
allow you to have a daily sodium level of either 2,300 mg or, by
making the noted changes, 1,500 mg. You'll also find that the
menus sometimes call for you to use lower sodium, low-fat, fat-free,
or reduced fat versions of products.
The menus are based on 2,000 calories a day—serving sizes should
be increased or decreased for other calorie levels. To ease the 
calculations, some of the serving sizes have been rounded off.
Also, some items may be in too small a quantity to have a listed
food group serving. Recipes for starred items are given on the later
pages. Some of these recipes give changes that can be used to lower
their sodium level.
---
Use the changes if you want to follow the DASH
eating plan at 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.

Discrimination Prohibited: Under provisions of
applicable public laws enacted by Congress
since 1964, no person in the United States shall,
on the grounds of race, color, national origin,
handicap, or age, be excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity (or,
on the basis of sex, with respect to any educa-
tion program or activity) receiving Federal finan-
cial assistance. In addition, Executive Order
11141 prohibits discrimination on the basis of
age by contractors and subcontractors in the
performance of Federal contracts, and Executive
Order 11246 states that no federally funded con-
tractor may discriminate against any employee or
applicant for employment because of race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin.
