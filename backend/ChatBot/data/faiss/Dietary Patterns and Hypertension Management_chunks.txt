Abstract: Currently, there is no global consensus about the essentiality of dietary chromium. To
provide evidence to this debate, an examination of blood chromium levels and common chronic
health conditions was undertaken. Using a subsample from the 2015–2016 US National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 2894; 40 years+), chi-square and binary logistic regres-
sion analyses were conducted to examine blood chromium levels (0.7–28.0 vs. <0.7 µg/L) and
their associations with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; self-report), diabetes mellitus (DM; glycohe-
moglobin ≥5.7%), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥5), while controlling for
socio-demographic (age/sex/income/education/relationship status) and health-related (red blood
cell folate/medications/co-morbidities/body mass index (BMI)/substance use) factors. The sample
was almost evenly distributed between men and women (n = 1391, 48.1% (men); n = 1503, 51.9%
(women)). The prevalence estimates of low blood chromium levels tended to be higher among those
with CVDs (47.4–47.6%) and DM (50.0–51.6%). Comparisons between those with low vs.

blood chromium levels indicate men have increased odds of CVDs (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.86,
95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.22–2.85, p < 0.001) and DM (aOR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.32–2.83, p < 0.001)
and lower odds of depression (aOR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.22–0.77, p < 0.05). Dietary chromium may be
important in the prevention and management of CVDs and DM for men. Continued exploration of
chromium’s role in chronic diseases, including differences by biological factors, is needed.

1. Introduction
Chromium is a trace dietary mineral that facilitates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism [1].
It is involved in glucose homeostasis as a critical cofactor for insulin action and as a
component of the glucose tolerance factor [2]. Food sources of chromium include whole
grain products, fruits, vegetables, nuts, bread, and meats [3,4].
About 60 years ago, chromium was deemed to be an essential dietary mineral based
on clinical studies where deﬁciency symptoms were observed among those receiving total
parenteral nutrition without chromium included in the solution [5,6]. However, in recent
years, there has been debate about whether dietary chromium is an essential nutrient.
The European Food Safety Authority Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies
has indicated that the data regarding chromium is too limited to establish recommended
chromium intake levels [5,7] due to challenges in quantifying chromium in foods as well as

body tissues and ﬂuids [8–10]. Furthermore, most biological research examining suboptimal
chromium intake and health outcomes has been limited to animal studies of chromium
deﬁciency [7]. In the United States (US), Canada, Australia, and New Zealand population-
based recommended intake levels have been established for chromium [11]. For example,
The Institute of Medicine, which deﬁnes the US and Canada’s Dietary Reference Intakes, have
established Adequate Intake (AI) levels for chromium as 35 µg/day for men and 25 µg/day
for women between 19–50 years, and 30 µg/day for men and 20 µg/day for women 51
years+ [8]. Due to limited mechanistic and epidemiological studies available, no global
consensus has been reached about the essentiality of dietary chromium [5].
Chromium has been linked with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs), diabetes mellitus (DM), and depression [12–17].
---
Chromium deﬁciency has been
associated with DM and CVDs, such as atherosclerosis [18], and chromium supplemen-
tation has been reported to have beneﬁcial effects on symptoms related to CVDs, type 2
DM, and depression [19,20]. It is also well known that these chronic physical and mental
health conditions can result from complex interactions of socio-demographic, behavioral,
environmental, psychological, and biological factors which can be catalyzed by challenging
life events [21–28].
CVDs, DM, and depression impose signiﬁcant global economic burdens. CVDs such
as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and rheumatic heart disease affect 523
million individuals worldwide [29] and account for 32.0% of all deaths globally [30]. The
global incidence for DM is estimated at 22.9 million [31] and it is the one of the leading
global causes of mortality [31,32]. Depression is a common mental health condition affecting
3.8% of the global population, including 5.0% among adults and 5.7% among adults older
than 60 years [21,33]. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide [22].
Most of the research to date about dietary chromium and chronic health conditions
has focused on the relationships between this trace mineral and DM. Cross-sectional and
case-control studies have reported that individuals with DM have lower serum chromium
levels compared to healthy individuals [2,34–37]. One cross-sectional study reported that
serum chromium levels were signiﬁcantly reduced in individuals with type 2 DM between
40 to 55 years compared to age and body mass index (BMI) matched controls [38]. A case-
control study reported that plasma chromium levels were signiﬁcantly lower in the type 2
and pre-DM groups compared to healthy individuals [39]. Furthermore, plasma chromium
concentrations were inversely associated with type 2 DM and pre-DM in Chinese adults,
and individuals with higher plasma chromium levels were less likely to have type 2 DM
and pre-DM [39]. Some studies, including a systematic review and meta-analysis, have
reported that supplementation of chromium can potentially help to control DM [20,36,40]
by improving glycemic control [41].
Chromium may also be important in the prevention and management of CVDs. It has
been shown that individuals with existing CVDs (e.g., coronary artery disease, myocardial
infarction) have lowered plasma chromium levels compared to healthy individuals [42,43].
Plasma chromium levels have also been reported to be negatively correlated with blood
pressure and low-density lipoproteins [44].
---
However, another study reported that individ-
uals with systolic dysfunction had increased serum chromium levels compared to those
with normal systolic function [45]. A cross-sectional study reported that increasing circu-
lating levels of chromium is associated with reduced lipid inﬁltration in the vascular wall
(echogenicity of the intima-media complex) in the elderly [46]. Systematic reviews and
meta-analyses indicate that chromium supplementation may have protective effects against
myocardial infarction, reduce CVD-associated inﬂammatory biomarkers [24], and decrease
diastolic blood pressure [41].
There is also a limited body of research which has explored relationships between
dietary chromium and depression [47]. Small clinical studies have reported that depres-
sion symptoms can be improved with chromium supplementation [19,48–51]. Interven-
tions aimed at increasing chromium intakes have also been recommended adjuncts to
anti-depressant medication treatment [52]. Clinical studies have reported that chromium
Nutrients 2022, 14, 2687

supplementation improves glucose regulation, reduces appetite, decreased weight gain,
and improves mood in individuals with depression [53].
Although research suggests that chromium may be important in the prevention and
management of CVDs, DM, and depression, most of these studies are based on intakes from
dietary or supplement sources. There has been limited investigations which have examined
more objective measures of chromium status, such as blood levels of the mineral, in relation
to these chronic physical and mental health conditions. Furthermore, most studies have
not accounted for various other factors which can affect chromium status in their analyses.
In the 2015–2016 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), blood
levels of chromium were measured in participants 40 years+ and information about CVDs,
DM, and depression was collected. The availability of this data provided an opportunity to
examine relationships between chromium status with these common physical and mental
health conditions, while controlling for various determinants of health. The ﬁndings
of this investigation can contribute evidence which will either support or refute that
dietary chromium is an essential trace mineral. It was hypothesized that there will be
signiﬁcant association between low blood levels of chromium and the presence of CVDs,
DM, and depression.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Sample
An analysis of 2015–2016 US NHANES [54] data was conducted. The sample is
comprised of a randomly selected non-institutionalized civilian population of all ages that
reside in 50 states and the District of Columbia [55].
---
The stratiﬁed, clustered sampling was
conducted in four stages: primary sampling units (PSUs) from all US counties (counties,
groups of tracts within counties, or combinations of adjacent counties); segments within
PSUs (census blocks or combinations of blocks); dwelling units (DUs); or households, within
segments, and individuals within households [55]. Prior to data collection, screening was
conducted at the DU level to identify eligible sampled persons based on oversampling
subgroups, which included Hispanic persons, non-Hispanic black persons, non-Hispanic
non-black Asian persons, non-Hispanic white persons and persons of other races and
ethnicities at or below 185% of the poverty threshold, and non-Hispanic white persons and
persons of other races and ethnicities aged 80 years+ [55]. The data collection consisted of in-
home interviews using Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing and physical examination
at Mobile Examination Centers (MEC). In-home interviews included socio-demographic,
dietary, and health-related questions. At the MEC, anthropometric, blood pressure, blood,
and urine measures, hearing and vision tests, as well as health status assessments were
conducted. Consent forms were signed by participants before in-home interviews and the
MEC exams were conducted.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Dependent Variables: Select Chronic Physical and Mental Health Conditions
This investigation included analysis of blood chromium levels in relation to three
separate dependent variables: CVDs, DM, and depression. CVDs were coded as 0 (no)
and 1 (yes) and were based on responses from questions about health condition diagnoses
during the home-based interviews. CVDs included congestive heart failure, coronary heart
disease, angina/angina pectoris, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension.
The measure, DM, was based on glycohemoglobin levels obtained from a blood sample
taken from participants in the MEC. The cut-off values used were <5.7% (no prediabetes or
diabetes; code 0) and ≥5.7% (prediabetes or diabetes; code 1) [56]. Full details about blood
sample collection and analysis are available elsewhere [57,58].
Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [59,60].
The PHQ-9 is a nine-item depression screening instrument which incorporates Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria [61]
to determine the frequency of depression symptoms over the past 2 weeks. The PHQ-

9 was administered by trained interviewers in the MEC using the Computer-Assisted
Personal Interview system which has built-in consistency checks [54].
---
When responding to
individual questions, participants answered according to one of the following categories:
“not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days”, and “nearly every day”. Each
category was assigned points ranging from 0 to 3. The sum of the score from the nine items
indicated the level of depression severity. A score of 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 19, and
20 to 27 indicated minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression
respectively [59,60]. A cut-off score of ≥5 was used for this analysis [59,60]. Based on
studies in primary care settings, the PHQ-9 has shown good reliability and validity. Internal
consistency of the PHQ-9 has been reported to have Cronbach alphas of 0.86 and 0.89, and
criteria validity has been veriﬁed in a sample of 580 individuals where structured clinical
interviews were conducted by a mental health professional [60].
2.2.2. Independent Variable: Blood Chromium Levels
The main independent variable of interest was blood chromium levels. In the 2015–
2016 US NHANES, human whole blood (optimal 2.0 mL, minimum 0.60 mL) samples were
collected from participants (40 years+) in the MEC [62]. Full details of sample analysis,
solutions preparation, base blood, and quality controls can be found in the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory Procedure Manual [62]. The maximum
concentration of chromium that was measurable was 5000 µg/L and the lower limit of
detection (LLOD) was 0.41 µg/L [62]. For analytes with results below the LLOD, an
imputed ﬁll value, calculated as the LLOD divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]),
was used [62]. For this study, the healthy reference range of 0.7 to 28.0 µg/L for blood
chromium levels was used [62–65]. The participants who provided blood samples also
completed a questionnaire about fasting status, which collected data related to length of
“food” fasts and whether the participant had gum, mints, coffee, tea, alcohol, or dietary
supplements before their laboratory examination [62].
2.3. Covariates
The covariates included social, economic, demographic, biological, and health vari-
ables that can potentially alter the relationship between blood chromium levels and the
studied chronic health conditions. Details of each variable are provided in the supplemen-
tary ﬁle (Supplementary Materials Table S1: Description of covariates). Further details
about each variable are also located on the NHANES website [54].

Analysis
The demographics, examination, laboratory, and questionnaire datasets from the 2015–
2016 cycle of the NHANES were merged using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) (version 24, IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL, USA) [66]. Descriptive analysis
included frequency counts and percentages by categories for all variables. Pearson chi-
square (χ2) tests were used on the unweighted data to assess for the associations between
each of the three chronic conditions, blood chromium levels categories (low versus normal),
and the covariates.
Three separate binary logistic regression analyses were conducted on the weighted
data; each assessed the relationships between a given physical (CVDs, DM) or mental
health (depression) condition while statistically controlling for all covariates. Adjusted
odds ratios (aORs), 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI), and p-values (level of signiﬁcance < 0.05)
were reported. The standardized weights were calculated by dividing the trimmed inﬂation
weight of each unit used in the analysis by the unweighted average of the survey weights
of all the analyzed units.

3. Results
3.1. Description of Overall Sample
The 2015–2016 NHANES sample of adults aged 40 years+ (n = 2894) were almost
evenly distributed by men (n = 1391; 48.1%) and women (n = 1503; 51.9%). Most had
blood chromium levels below the normal range (n = 2654, 91.7%) and none were above the
reference range. Most were 60 years+ (n = 1443, 49.9%), had graduated from high school
and/or have some post-secondary education (n = 1461, 50.5%), were married and/or
living with a partner (n = 1828, 63.2%), and had an annual income less than $25,000 USD
(n = 883, 30.5%) (Supplementary Materials Table S2). Most had red blood cell (RBC) folate
levels below/within the normal range (n = 2034, 70.3%) and no health conditions (n = 1158,
40.0%). Most were considered obese (n = 1267, 43.8%). About half of the sample were
taking medications used to treat CVDs (n = 1479, 51.1%).

CVDs
About half of the men (n = 723, 52.0%) and women (n = 783, 52.1%) had CVDs
and among those with these health conditions, almost half had low blood chromium
levels (n = 660, 47.4% (men); n = 716, 47.6% (women)) (Supplementary Materials Table S2).
Prevalence estimates of CVDs for men and women were higher among those aged 60 years+
(n = 466, 33.5% (men); n = 500, 33.3% (women)), high school graduates or those who had
some post-secondary education (n = 400, 28.8% (men); n = 412, 27.4% (women)), those who
were married and/or living with partner (n = 504, 36.2% (men); n = 378, 25.1% (women)),
and those who earned less than $25,000 USD per year (n = 250, 18.0% (men); n = 311, 20.7%
(women)) (Supplementary Materials Table S2). Men and women with RBC folate levels
below/within the normal range (n = 475, 34.1% (men); n = 506, 33.7% (women)), with no
depression (n = 555, 39.9% (men); n = 504, 33.5% (women)), or with DM ((n = 477, 34.3%
(men); n = 529, 35.2% (women)) had among the highest prevalence estimates for CVDs.
Men considered to be moderate drinkers (n = 301, 21.6%) or who had smoked at least
100 cigarettes in their lifetime (n = 472, 33.9%) had higher levels of CVDs. Unlike men,
women who did not report drinking behavior (n = 396, 26.3%) and had smoked less than
100 cigarettes in their lifetime (n = 492, 32.7%) had higher prevalence estimates of CVDs.
Results of the χ2 statistical analysis indicate that blood chromium levels are not as-
sociated with CVDs. However, most socio-demographic and health-related factors were
signiﬁcantly associated with CVDs (p’s < 0.05) (Supplementary Materials Table S2). Speciﬁ-
cally, associations with CVDs were found for age, education, marital status, income, RBC
folate, multi-morbidity, DM, depression (women only), BMI, CVDs-related medications,
drinking behavior (women only), and smoking.
Only men with low blood chromium levels had signiﬁcantly higher odds of CVDs
when compared to normal blood chromium levels (aOR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.22–2.85, p < 0.001)
(Table 1). In addition, signiﬁcant associations were observed for socio-demographic and
health-related variables among men and women. For women who were more educated,
there were lower odds of CVDs compared to those who were not high school graduates
(aOR = 1.75 vs. 2.20, p’s < 0.001).
---
For men, the odds of CVDs were 2.36 times higher
for those who were married and/or living with a partner compared to those who were
widowed, divorced, or separated (aOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.38–4.03, p < 0.001). Among health-
related measures, men with one health condition (aOR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50–0.93, p < 0.05)
had lower odds of CVDs compared to those with no health conditions. Compared to
individuals with weights in the healthy range, those who were overweight or obese had
lower odds of depression (aOR = 0.44–0.63 (men), 0.43–0.56 (women), p’s < 0.001). For
health behaviors, men who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime had lower odds
of CVDs (aOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59–0.97, p < 0.05) compared to those who smoked less
than 100 cigarettes. Women who were not moderate drinkers had higher odds of CVDs
(aOR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.02–2.96, p < 0.05).

3.2.2. DM
In the total sample (n = 2894), about one quarter of both men (n = 783/2894, 27.1%)
and women had DM (n = 829/2894, 28.6%) and, among those with this condition, at least
50% had low blood chromium levels (n = 718, 51.6% (men); n = 752, 50.0% (women))
(Supplementary Materials Table S2). Prevalence estimates of DM that were more than one
quarter of the sample for men and women respectively were found among those 60 years+
(n = 459, 33.0% (men); n = 480, 31.9% (women)), who were high school graduates or had
some post-secondary education (n = 393, 28.3% (men); n = 406, 27.0% (women)), were
married and/or living with partner (n = 576, 41.4% (men); n = 426, 28.3% (women)), had
RBC folate levels below/within the normal range (n = 551, 39.6% (men); n = 558, 37.1%
(women)), had at least two health conditions (n = 410, 29.5% (men); n = 495, 32.9% (women)),
or no depression (n = 602, 43.3% (men); n = 556, 37.0% (women)). Men who were considered
obese (n = 348, 25.0%) or overweight (n = 296, 21.3%) had similar prevalence estimates for
DM. Men who were considered moderate drinkers (n = 322, 23.1%) and had smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime (n = 474, 34.1%) had higher prevalence of DM. Women
who did not report drinking behavior (n = 432, 28.7%) or smoked less than 100 cigarettes
(n = 545, 36.3%) had higher prevalence of DM.
The results of the χ2 statistical analyses indicated that blood chromium levels were
not signiﬁcantly associated with DM.
---
However, some socio-demographic factors and most
health-related factors were signiﬁcantly associated with DM (p’s < 0.05) (Supplementary
Materials Table S2); speciﬁcally, age, education, marital status (women only), income, multi-
morbidity, depression (women only), BMI, DM-related medications, and drinking behavior.
The odds of DM were 1.93 times higher for men with low blood chromium levels
compared to those with normal levels (aOR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.32–2.83, p < 0.001) (Table 1).
Men and women between 50–59 years had lower odds of DM (aOR 0.47–0.48, p’s < 0.001)
compared to those between 40–49 years. For men who were high school graduates or had
some post-secondary education, the odds of DM were higher (aOR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.04–2.31,
p < 0.05) compared to those who were not high school graduates. Women who were at
least post-secondary graduates had lower odds of DM (aOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.50–0.81, p
< 0.001). Men who were married or living with a partner (aOR = 3.22, 95% CI: 1.87–5.53,
p < 0.001) or never married (aOR = 3.50, 95% CI: 2.11–5.79, p < 001) had higher odds of
DM when compared to those who were separated, divorced, or widowed. Among health-
related measures, men and women with high RBC folate levels had higher odds of DM
(aOR = 1.55 (men), aOR = 1.33 (women), p’s < 0.05) compared to those with RBC folate
levels below/within the normal ranges. Men who were diagnosed with two or more health
conditions had higher odds of DM (aOR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02–1.83, p < 0.05) compared to
those who had no health conditions. Men and women who reported depression had lower
odds of DM (aOR = 0.69 (men), 0.62 (women), p’s < 0.05) compared to those who did report
depression. Men and women who were overweight or obese had lower odds of DM (aORs
range 0.28–0.55, p’s < 0.001) compared to those whose body weight were within the healthy
range. For health behaviors, men and women who did not report alcohol drinking had
lower odds of DM (aOR = 0.64 (men), aOR = 0.51 (women), p’s < 0.05) compared to those
who reported moderate levels of drinking. Men who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their
lifetime had lower odds of DM (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55–0.89, p < 0.05) compared to those
who smoked less than 100 cigarettes.

Depression
Less than one quarter of men (n = 296, 21.3%) and almost one-third of women (n = 445,
29.6%) had depression. Among those with this condition, about one quarter had low blood
chromium levels (n = 273, 19.6% (men); n = 409, 27.2% (women)) (Supplementary Materials
Table S2). The prevalence of depression for both men and women was higher among
those who were 60 years+ (n = 145, 10.4% (men); n = 213, 14.2% (women)), high school
graduates or those who had some post-secondary education (n = 142, 10.2% (men); n = 229,

(women)), and earned less than $25,000 USD per year (n = 125, 9.0% (men); n = 191, 12.7%
(women)). Men and women with RBC folate levels below/within the normal range (n = 210,
15.1% (men); n = 297, 19.8% (women), two or more health conditions (n = 181, 13.0% (men);
n = 300, 20.0% (women)), or DM (n = 181, 13.0% (men); n = 273, 18.2% (women)) had
higher prevalence estimates of depression. Men who drank moderate amounts of alcohol
(n = 101, 7.3%) or smoked at least 100 cigarettes (n = 203, 14.6%) had higher prevalence of
depression. Women who did not report drinking alcohol (n = 208, 13.8%) or smoked less
than 100 cigarettes (n = 250, 16.6%) had higher prevalence estimates of depression.
Results of the χ2 statistical analysis indicated that blood chromium levels were not
signiﬁcantly associated with depression. However, most socio-demographic and health-
related variables were signiﬁcantly associated with depression (p’s < 0.05). Speciﬁcally, age
(men only), education, marital status, income, multi-morbidity, DM (women only), BMI
(women only), mental health-related medications, drinking behavior, and smoking were
signiﬁcantly associated with depression.
Men with low blood chromium levels had lower odds of depression (aOR = 0.42,
95% CI: 0.22–0.77, p < 0.05) compared to those with normal levels (Table 1). Similar to the
results for CVDs and DM, signiﬁcant associations were observed for socio-demographic
and health-related variables. Men and women 50 years+ had higher odds of depression
(aOR = 1.72–3.50, p’s < 0.05) compared to those between 40–49 years.
---
Men and women
who were high school graduates or had some post-secondary education as well as women
who were post-secondary graduates had higher odds of depression (aORs = 1.40–1.93,
p’s < 0.05) compared to those who were not high school graduates. The odds of depression
for men who were married and/or living with a partner were almost three times higher
(aOR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.60–5.14, p < 0.001) compared to those who were widowed, divorced,
or separated. Among health-related measures, men with high RBC folate levels had higher
odds of depression (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10–2.06, p < 0.05) compared to those with levels
below/within the normal range. Individuals with at least one health condition had lower
odds of depression (aORs = 0.38–0.61, p’s < 0.05) compared to those who had no health
conditions. Women with DM had lower odds of depression (aOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.43–
0.69, p < 0.001) compared to those without DM. Individuals taking mental health-related
medications had lower odds of depression (aOR = 0.23 (men), 0.31 (women), p’s < 0.001)
compared to those who did not take these medications.
4. Discussion
This study examined associations between blood chromium levels and CVDs, DM,
and depression. Among adults aged 40 years+, the prevalence estimates of CVDs, DM, and
depression are higher for men and women with low blood chromium levels compared to
those with normal levels. Bivariate analysis indicated no signiﬁcant associations between
blood chromium levels and the three health outcomes. Results of the binary logistic
regression analyses, where various determinants of health were accounted for, indicated
signiﬁcant associations between blood chromium levels and the three health outcomes.
Notably, men with low blood chromium levels were more likely to have CVDs and DM
and less likely to have depression.
The results found for men are consistent with existing knowledge that suggests in-
adequate dietary chromium is associated with CVDs and DM [12–16]. Furthermore, it
supports the higher AI levels of dietary chromium the Institute of Medicine has set for
mid-age and older men (19–50 years: AI 35 µg/day for men and 25 µg/day for women;
51 years+: 30 µg/day for men and 20 µg/day for women [8]).

Studies indicate that triva-
lent chromium is a cofactor for a biologically active molecule that enhances the effects of
insulin, a hormone which inﬂuences the metabolism of carbohydrates, fat, and protein [70],
and therefore plays a role in CVDs and DM. Previous studies suggest a possible mecha-
nism of action includes a chromium-induced increase in the insulin receptor number and
insulin binding at its site of action [71]. Chromium increases 5′-AMP-activated protein
Nutrients 2022, 14, 2687
11 of 16
kinase activity, resulting in the suppression of a sterol regulatory element-binding protein
(SREBP)-1. SREBP-1 contributes to the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol, triglycerides,
fatty acids, and phospholipids [12,72]. Chromium has been shown to increase free fatty
acid oxidation and decrease fatty acid synthesis [20]. Among those with DM and CVDs,
low blood levels of chromium are prevalent and this might be due to the diminution of
insulin signal transduction and contribute to insulin resistance [73]. Chromium losses and
excretion increase with aging and are also related to DM [73]. When losses occur among
those with DM for more than 2 years, chromium homeostasis may be altered [74].
It is surprising that for women no signiﬁcant associations between blood chromium
levels and CVDs or DM were found. However, in a separate analysis, where the outcome of
DM was based on self-report, a signiﬁcant association for women was found (aOR = 1.99,
p < 0.001). Although glycohemoglobin is an objective measure, it is important to note that
two elevated results are needed for diagnosis of prediabetes or diabetes. The NHANES
only reported one result. It is possible that a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of
prediabetes and diabetes in the sample was somewhere between the indicated glycohe-
moglobin values and the self-report measure of DM. As such, there may be signiﬁcant
association between blood chromium levels and DM for women also.
The results related to blood chromium and depression seem counterintuitive. When
compared to those with normal blood chromium levels, men had lower odds for depression
and for women no signiﬁcant association was found. It was thought this may be due to
the PHQ-9 cut-off of mild depression which was used. However, when we conducted a
subsequent analysis with a higher moderate depression cut-off (>9), the association between
men and women with low blood chromium levels was non-signiﬁcant.
---
It has been reported
that chromium functions in regulating fat metabolism and energy homeostasis by enhancing
insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus, resulting in increased production of serotonin,
norepinephrine, and melatonin [52,53]. It has also been indicated that the serotonergic
pathway and polymorphisms that occur in genes related to the pathway are strongly
linked with depression [75]. Based on ﬁndings from pre-clinical and clinical studies,
chromium may have antidepressant potential as it has been shown that the provision of
supplemental sources improves glucose regulation and improves mood in individuals with
depression [53]. However, many of these studies did not account for either dietary intake
or blood levels of chromium or for other relevant factors such as RBC folate status, presence
of physical health conditions, or substance use. Clearly, further investigative work related
to chromium and depression is needed.
Consistent with other ﬁndings, our study reports that factors such as older age,
education, relationship status, income, high RBC folate levels, multimorbidity, BMI, alcohol
intake, and smoking are signiﬁcantly associated with CVDs, DM, and depression [21–28,76].
However, there are some surprising results. Across the three conditions, older age showed
both lower (CVDs in women; DM in men and women) and higher odds (depression in
men and women). Differences in the odds of depression by educational attainment and
income levels may be due to the lack of account of current employment status. Longitudinal
investigations have indicated that, among those without depression at baseline, individuals
with a secondary school education or less have a higher likelihood of developing a major
depressive episode than more educated working respondents [77]. However, among the
unemployed, a higher risk of major depression was found for those with a higher level of
education [77]. The higher odds of CVDs among men who were married or living with a
partner was surprising. Better prognosis in married individuals has been reported after
myocardial infarction [78–83] and stroke [84], whereas other studies found that marital
status had no inﬂuence on CVD [85–87]. The lower odds of depression among those
with DM may be because many had their condition long-term, and they have adjusted
psychologically. The lower odds of CVDs and depression found among co-morbidity levels
may be because other common conditions with high morbidity (e.g., DM), were included
as separate variables in the regression analysis.
---
The lower odds of CVDs and DM among
men and women who were overweight or obese may be a result of applying the same
Nutrients 2022, 14, 2687
12 of 16
BMI cut-offs across all ages. Some studies suggest that BMI status and disease risk across
adult age groups has a U-shaped relationship [88]. Finally, the lower odds of CVDs and
DM among men who smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime may be due to
measurement concerns with the 100-cigarette smoking screen [89].
To the best of our knowledge, this study appears to be among the ﬁrst to report
associations between blood chromium levels and common chronic physical and mental
health conditions, while accounting for several determinants of health. The sex-speciﬁc
signiﬁcant associations found for CVDs and DM suggest that chromium has an essential
role in the prevention and management of these conditions, and these differ among men
and women. In industrial countries, insufﬁcient intakes of dietary chromium have been
reported and found to be associated with alterations in glucose metabolism, especially in
older adults [90]. Other studies have also found associations of low plasma chromium
levels with hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, high inﬂammatory status, and increased
cardiovascular risk [44]. There is evidence for the efﬁcacy of chromium supplementation to
improve dyslipidemia and glucose levels in type 2 DM [91]. However, knowledge gaps
remain in terms of how chromium deﬁciency and toxicity may be deﬁned and who is
affected. Future investigations could include subgroup analyses of chromium status and
disease outcomes, where feasible, across different age and ethnic groups. Longitudinal
analysis would also allow for causal inferences to be made about blood chromium levels
and chronic condition outcomes. Studies which focus on improved measures of chromium
intake and status would advance knowledge about the role of this trace mineral in chronic
disease prevention and management.
The results of this study need to be considered in the context of its limitations. Given
that the data was cross-sectional, the direction of the relationships between the health
outcomes and blood chromium levels cannot be ascertained. There are many pathophysio-
logical processes that are involved in CVDs, DM, and depression and thus it was impossible
to account for all variables that may affect the relationships between the health outcomes
and different health determinants. The use of self-report measures for many of the variables
made misreporting and misclassiﬁcation possible.
---
Variables such as dietary chromium
intake, ethnicity, other blood nutrient levels, dietary intakes, mental/brain-related health
conditions, and illicit drug use were not included in the logistic regression analysis as they
were unavailable. We used the reference ranges for blood chromium available from the
CDC; however, it should be noted that there is no consensus on an international acceptable
range in the general population. Finally, inferences made from our investigation only
pertain to adults 40 years+ since the collection of blood chromium samples were only
performed for this age group.
5. Conclusions
CVDs, DM, and depression are leading contributors to disability worldwide. This
study, which examined relationships between blood chromium levels, CVDs, DM, and
depression, while accounting for other important health determinants showed that men
with low blood chromium levels had higher odds of CVDs and DM. These ﬁndings suggest
chromium is essential for human health and its requirements in relation to these health
outcomes differ between men and women. These results appear to indicate that chromium
is an essential trace mineral which should be included in population-based dietary intake
guidelines. Further investigations related to the role of chromium in physical and mental
health conditions are warranted, particularly those which examine differences by sex and
other biological variables such as age, ethnicity, and genetics.
