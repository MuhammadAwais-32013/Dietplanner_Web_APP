To Whom It May Concern 
I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Muhammad Awais, a final semester 
student in the  BS Computer Science (BSCS) program at National University of Modern 
Languages, Islamabad. Mr. Awais is currently working under my supervision for his Final Year 
Project.
Muhammad  Awais  is  an  exceptionally  dedicated  and  analytically  strong student, 
demonstrating a focused passion for advanced Artificial Intelligence. For his Final Year 
Project, a Traffic Monitoring and Management system, he successfully handled the complex 
AI component, specifically implementing the YOLO model for real-time traffic detection and 
monitoring. This  required  deep  analytical  skills  and  the  ability  to  translate  complex 
algorithms into functional code.
I strongly recommend Muhammad Awais for admission and scholarship opportunities in 
your MS AI, Generative AI, or Agentic AI programs. His established foundation in computer 
vision and his specialized interest in next-generation AI will lead to significant contributions 
in your academic environment.
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any additional information.
Sincerely,
  Muhammad Naveed Alam (Former HOD)
 Assistant Professor 
 Department of Computer
